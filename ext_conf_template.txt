  # cat=basic; type=int+; label= Use Central storage: Here you can switch the BackEnd behaviour accessing categories, targetgroups, locations and organizers. If you set this value to a sysfolder(!) ID, categories, targetgroups, organizers and locations are only taken from this spezific sysfolder and are no more allowed on normal pages. Use this for several calendars using the same cats or if you want to rid normal pages of entries for categories, etc. If you set the value to "0" (default), categories, targetgroups, organizers and locations are taken from the same page as the calendarevents are from. Use this when you want to have several independend calendars. Note: You can always tell your plugins to use calendardata from this or that page.
